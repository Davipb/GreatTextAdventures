# Great Text Adventures

This a simple experiment/project that aims to recreate old Text Adventure games that had no graphics, only a console output. It's almost completly randomly generated because game design is hard, and it's better to say you have bad luck than a bad game designer.

The project is under the [Unlicense](UNLICENSE), which means you can do whatever you want with this. No, really, want to steal it and tell your teachers you made it? Do it, I don't care.

If you want to contribute, though, just send me a pull request!
